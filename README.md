# Unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge
Module 20

This module and project utilize unsupervised machine learning algorithms to be able to categorize data to make a model and cluster the data into groups.

** concepts utilized on the project: ** <br />
<ul>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Cleaning and standardizing data in order for it to be processed by a unsupervised machine learning algorithm</li>
<li>K-map (K nearest neighbor)</li>
<li>Analyzing results of unsupervised machine learning algorithms and make recommendations </li>
</ul>


Step one is the Prepare the Data:
Preparing the data requires the removal of non-impactful variables such as the target column in the csv. some data and skew unsupervised machine learning algorithms

The next step is to reduce the data set with different methods such as dimensionality reduction and t-SNE

The final step is to use K-means to find the correct number of cluster groupings

The inertia begins to slow down when K = 3, yielding a recommendation of 3 groups based off of K-means.
